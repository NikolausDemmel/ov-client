## Installation instructions

For installation instructions see file [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

Currently, only the [ORLANDOviols](http://box.orlandoviols.com/)
configuration server is supported. This means that once your
installation is ready you need to create an account at
ovbox.orlandoviols.com. If you need assistance do not hesitate to
contact us via email.

The interface to the [digital stage](https://digital-stage.org/)
configuration server is currently under development.

## User manual

A user manual for the ORLANDOviols configuration server can be found
on the [wiki](https://github.com/gisogrimm/ovbox/wiki).

## ovbox

The ov-client is a re-implementation of the ovbox, for compatibility
with the digital stage. More details can be found in the [ovbox
repository](https://github.com/gisogrimm/ovbox).
