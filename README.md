# ov-client

## Dependencies

This tool requires the TASCAR components libtascar (library),
libtascar-dev (headers) and the plugins from tascar_cli.

## Installation instructions

For installation instructions see file [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

Currently, only the [ORLANDOviols](http://box.orlandoviols.com/)
configuration server is supported. This means that once your
installation is ready you may wish to get an account at
box.orlandoviols.com - in that case please contact us via e-mail.

The interface to the [digital stage](https://digital-stage.org/)
configuration server is currently under development.

## User manual

A user manual for the ORLANDOviols configuration server can be found
on the [wiki](https://github.com/gisogrimm/ovbox/wiki).

## ovbox

The ov-client is a re-implementation of the ovbox, for compatibility
with the digital stage. More details can be found in the [ovbox
repository](https://github.com/gisogrimm/ovbox).
