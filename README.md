## Installation instructions

For installation instructions see [Wiki pages](https://github.com/gisogrimm/ovbox/wiki/Installation).

Currently, only the [ORLANDOviols](http://box.orlandoviols.com/)
configuration server is supported. This means that once your
installation is ready you need to create an account at
box.orlandoviols.com. If you need assistance do not hesitate to
contact us via email.

The interface to the [digital stage](https://digital-stage.ovbox.de/)
configuration server will also work, although some features will be
missing.

## User manual

A user manual for the ORLANDOviols configuration server can be found
on the [wiki](https://github.com/gisogrimm/ovbox/wiki).

verion on MacOS. More details can be found in the [ovbox
repository](https://github.com/gisogrimm/ovbox).
